The traditional manual method of taking attendance in educational institutions is:
● Time-consuming
● Susceptible to inaccuracies
● Human errors
● Proxy attendances
The traditional digital method of taking attendance
● Adds financial burden on dedicated biometric device investment","What is your idea to solve the problem?
Due to the aforementioned challenges, we propose the following from the student’s perspective:
 Develop a mobile application for attendance tracking.
 Enable students to scan a dynamic classroom QR code with their smartphones for attendance (to eliminate proxy attendance).
 Integrate facial recognition for accuracy and spoof prevention.
And these from the faculty’s perspective:
 Store attendance records in an excel file for easy access and reporting.
 Generation of a dynamic QR code that changes to prevent proxies
 Easy training of student’s faces from a particular class
By leveraging these innovative technologies, our digital attendance system offers convenient mobile-based attendance marking, using time-sensitive QR codes and 3D face liveness detection for enhanced
accuracy. This streamlines attendance tracking, reduces administrative burden, and fosters a more efficient
learning environment.","Can you provide details about the

The traditional digital method of taking attendance
Adds financial burden on dedicated biometric device investment","Due to the aforementioned challenges, we propose the following from the student’s perspective:
Develop a mobile application for attendance tracking.
Enable students to scan a dynamic classroom QR code with their smartphones for attendance (to eliminate proxy attendance).
Integrate facial recognition for accuracy and spoof prevention.

And these from the faculty’s perspective:
Store attendance records in an excel file for easy access and reporting.
Generation of a dynamic QR code that changes to prevent proxies
Easy training of student’s faces from a particular class

By leveraging these innovative technologies, our digital attendance system offers convenient mobile-based attendance marking, using time-sensitive QR codes and 3D face liveness detection for enhanced accuracy. This streamlines attendance tracking, reduces administrative burden, and fosters a more efficient learning environment.","Cross-platform development for native-looking mobile apps for Android and iOS devices.
Backend Server (Flask API, Python)
Handles requests from the frontend, processes data, and interacts with other components.
Face Recognition component (OpenCV)
Face identification in real-time processing to record attendance.
QR Code Generation component (QRcode library)
Usage of timed QR codes to prevent attendance fraud.
Report Generation component (Openpyxl)
Generates Excel attendance reports with convenient download choices.
Liveliness Detection component (OpenCV)
Detects liveliness in facial movements to reduce the likelihood of false positives.","Prathyuma V 20MIA1030

Upon completion of the assessment, users will receive personalized feedback indicating their level of depression, categorized as mild, moderate, or severe.

Based on the user's depression level, the website will curate a selection of audio recordings, videos, and stories designed to provide support, encouragement, and coping strategies tailored to their needs. These resources will cover topics such as self-care, resilience-building, and overcoming challenges associated with depression.

Additionally, users will have the option to connect with licensed counselors through various modalities, including video calls, audio calls, and chat sessions. They can choose their preferred counselor based on factors such as specialization, availability, and communication preferences.

To ensure ongoing support and progress monitoring, the website will incorporate feedback mechanisms and periodic reassessment tools. Users will have the opportunity to provide feedback on their experiences with the platform and counseling services, allowing for continuous improvement and optimization of the user experience.

Overall, our project aims to create a user-friendly, accessible, and effective online platform that empowers individuals to assess their mental health, access relevant support resources, and connect with professional counselors for personalized assistance in managing depression.

"Mansurah","M","Innov8","Student's Wellbeing","VIT Chennai","Students often face challenges in navigating their academic and professional journey, including choosing the right courses, finding relevant internships, and building a successful career path. They may feel overwhelmed by the choices available and lack guidance from experienced individuals.

Limited Access to University Resources: The restricted availability of mentorship, career advice, and job opportunities within the university ecosystem leaves students feeling unsupported and unprepared for the transition into their desired careers.

Limited Networking Opportunities: A lack of networking opportunities deprives students of valuable connections and mentorship, impeding their ability to access career opportunities and professional development.

Isolation and Lack of Support: The absence of a supportive community leaves students feeling isolated and discouraged, hindering their ability to overcome challenges and achieve success in their career endeavors.

Inadequate Interview Preparation: Insufficient preparation for job interviews increases the likelihood of anxiety and underperformance, resulting in missed opportunities for career progression.

Uncertainty About Job Requirements: Ambiguity surrounding job requirements leaves students ill-prepared for the workforce, causing frustration and difficulty in securing suitable employment.

Insufficient Insights into Potential Employers: Without insights into potential employers, students may struggle to find organizations that align with their career aspirations, leading to dissatisfaction and a lack of fulfillment in their roles.

There is a need for a platform that helps students connect with alumni and peers, and receive guidance to make informed decisions about their academic and professional futures.","Proposed Solution?

To address the challenges faced by current students in navigating their academic and professional journey, we propose the development of a comprehensive platform that connects students with alumni and peers, provides access to relevant resources and information, and offers guidance and support. The platform will include the following key features:

1.Connect with Alumni and Peers:
A networking feature that allows students to connect with alumni and peers based on shared interests, courses, and career goals.
Features for alumni to share their experiences, insights, and advice with students, fostering a sense of community and mentorship.

2.Access to Relevant Resources and Information:
Course and internship recommendations based on academic interests and career goals.
A curated library of articles, videos, and other educational resources to help students explore new topics and develop new skills.

3.Guidance and Support:
Mentorship programs that pair students with alumni mentors for personalized guidance and support.
Career counseling services to help students explore career paths, prepare for interviews, and build their professional network.

4.Personalized Dashboard:
A personalized dashboard for each student, where they can track their academic progress, upcoming events, and mentorship connections.
Notifications for relevant opportunities, such as internships, workshops, and networking events.

5.Community Forum:
A community forum where students, alumni, and peers can ask questions, share experiences, and collaborate on projects.
Moderated by alumni and faculty to ensure a positive and constructive environment.

6..Success Stories and Insights:
Success stories of alumni who have excelled in their careers, providing inspiration and motivation to current students.
Insights into companies where alumni work, including job roles, career paths, and company culture.

By providing students with a platform that connects them with alumni and peers, offers access to relevant resources and information, and provides guidance and support, we aim to empower students to make informed decisions about their academic and professional futures, and succeed in their chosen fields.","Flutter

The absence of a streamlined digital system results in challenges such as inaccurate visitor records, difficulty in verifying visitor identities, and inadequate mechanisms for tracking visitor exits. Additionally, the reliance on manual processes increases the risk of errors and delays in responding to security incidents or emergencies.","In response to the challenges posed by traditional visitor entry processes, 'Ingress Regulator' offers a modern, digitized solution that revolutionizes visitor management in Indian organizations and buildings. By leveraging real-time communication and authentication methods, the system ensures secure and efficient visitor entry while maintaining a seamless user experience.
Key Features:
1. Digital Visitor Log: Visitors input their details including name, mobile number, address, purpose of visit and estimated exit time via a user-friendly interface upon entry. This data is securely stored in a centralized database for easy access and management.
 Mobile Number Verification: Upon entering their mobile number, visitors undergo a verification process using two methods:
a). Automated Call Verification: Automated calls to the provided mobile number, verifying the visitor's identity through voice prompts or authentication codes.
b). OTP Verification: Alternatively, visitors may receive a one-time password (OTP) via SMS for verification. The system validates the OTP entered by the visitor to confirm their identity.
2. Automated Reminders: The system sends SMS reminders as the estimated exit time approaches, prompting visitors to update their status if needed. This ensures timely exits and efficient management of visitor traffic.
3. Security Enhancements: Incorporate robust security measures to safeguard visitor data and prevent unauthorized access. This includes encryption techniques, access controls, and regular security audits to mitigate potential risks.
4. Analytics and Reporting: Provide administrators with comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities to track visitor traffic patterns, identify trends, and generate insights for informed decision-making.","Backend :NestJs/NodeJsFlask(Python)

Upon completion of the assessment, users will receive personalized feedback indicating their level of depression, categorized as mild, moderate, or severe.

Based on the user's depression level, the website will curate a selection of audio recordings, videos, and stories designed to provide support, encouragement, and coping strategies tailored to their needs. These resources will cover topics such as self-care, resilience-building, and overcoming challenges associated with depression.

Additionally, users will have the option to connect with licensed counselors through various modalities, including video calls, audio calls, and chat sessions. They can choose their preferred counselor based on factors such as specialization, availability, and communication preferences.

To ensure ongoing support and progress monitoring, the website will incorporate feedback mechanisms and periodic reassessment tools. Users will have the opportunity to provide feedback on their experiences with the platform and counseling services, allowing for continuous improvement and optimization of the user experience.

Overall, our project aims to create a user-friendly, accessible, and effective online platform that empowers individuals to assess their mental health, access relevant support resources, and connect with professional counselors for personalized assistance in managing depression.

"Bhavya","Mishra","SANKALP SAGAR","Security and Access Control","VIT Chennai","Traditional visitor entry processes in organizations and buildings across India rely on manual, paper-based methods, leading to inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and lack of real-time monitoring. The absence of a streamlined digital system results in challenges such as inaccurate visitor records, difficulty in verifying visitor identities, and inadequate mechanisms for tracking visitor exits. Additionally, the reliance on manual processes increases the risk of errors and delays in responding to security incidents or emergencies.","In response to the challenges posed by traditional visitor entry processes, '**Ingress Regulator**' offers a modern, digitized solution that revolutionizes visitor management in Indian organizations and buildings. By leveraging real-time communication and authentication methods, the system ensures secure and efficient visitor entry while maintaining a seamless user experience.

Key Features:

1. Digital Visitor Log: Visitors input their details including name, mobile number, address, purpose of visit and estimated exit time via a user-friendly interface upon entry. This data is securely stored in a centralized database for easy access and management.
 Mobile Number Verification: Upon entering their mobile number, visitors undergo a verification process using two methods:
a). Automated Call Verification: Automated calls to the provided mobile number, verifying the visitor's identity through voice prompts or authentication codes.
b). OTP Verification: Alternatively, visitors may receive a one-time password (OTP) via SMS for verification. The system validates the OTP entered by the visitor to confirm their identity.

2. Automated Reminders: The system sends SMS reminders as the estimated exit time approaches, prompting visitors to update their status if needed. This ensures timely exits and efficient management of visitor traffic.

3. Security Enhancements: Incorporate robust security measures to safeguard visitor data and prevent unauthorized access. This includes encryption techniques, access controls, and regular security audits to mitigate potential risks.

4. Analytics and Reporting: Provide administrators with comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities to track visitor traffic patterns, identify trends, and generate insights for informed decision-making.","Backend: NestJS/NodeJS/Flask(Python)

The proposed solution is to develop and implement an online token system based on the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) principle, leveraging digital technology to streamline the appointment and waiting process at the health center. This system aims to ensure an equitable and efficient mechanism for managing patient flow, significantly improving the healthcare experience for both students and staff.","The proposed system is a queue management application catering to two primary entities: doctors and students. Doctors utilize a dedicated dashboard to oversee the queue status, while students interact with a personalized dashboard to secure appointments. Flask is selected for the backend infrastructure, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript constitute the frontend interface. SQL Alchemy is employed for database management.

# *Key Features:*

***Doctor Dashboard:***

Provides real-time visibility into the queue status.
Facilitates efficient management of appointments.
Enables access to student visit logs for medical center records.

***Student Dashboard:***

Allows students to book appointment tokens.
Offers a user-friendly interface for managing appointments and viewing relevant details.

***Appointment Workflow:***

When a student requests a token, appointment details are promptly relayed to the doctor's dashboard.
Doctors can then notify students about their upcoming appointments to ensure streamlined coordination.","**Database Schema Design:**

Utilize SQL Alchemy to architect the database schema, encompassing entities such as doctors, students, appointments, and visit logs. Establish appropriate relationships between these entities.

**Backend Development with Flask:**

Develop RESTful APIs using Flask to handle operations such as token requests, appointment management, and visit log retrieval. Ensure robust error handling and validation mechanisms.

**Frontend Development:**

Implement responsive frontend interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Design intuitive doctor and student dashboards tailored to their respective needs, incorporating features like appointment scheduling and queue monitoring.

**Token Request and Notification System:**

Upon a student's token request, swiftly update the doctor's dashboard with the relevant appointment details.
Enable doctors to notify students about upcoming appointments through the application interface or external communication channels.

**Logging and Audit Trail:**

Implement comprehensive logging mechanisms to track student visits and appointments for audit and record-keeping purposes.

**Testing and Deployment:**

Conduct rigorous testing to validate system functionality, security, and performance.
Deploy the application to a production environment following best practices for scalability and reliability.

**Conclusion:**
By leveraging Flask for backend development, HTML/CSS/JS for frontend design, and SQL Alchemy for database management, the proposed queue management system ensures seamless coordination between doctors and students. With features like real-time updates, appointment scheduling, and robust logging capabilities, the system aims to enhance operational efficiency and improve the overall healthcare experience for all stakeholders.","Dhanush M - 21BAI1744

 In hostel environments, ensuring the security of personal belongings and maintaining privacy within individual rooms is paramount. However, the absence of a reliable surveillance system often leaves occupants vulnerable to unauthorized entry by individuals who do not belong to the room. This lack of security poses a significant risk to the safety and privacy of hostel residents.

 There's a need for a simple, effective solution to notify room occupants of unauthorized entries.

 - Current surveillance systems often lack the capability to detect and alert residents to the intrusion of animals especially monkeys. As a result, hostel residents are vulnerable to property damage, injury, and health hazards caused by monkey invasions."," The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a robust security system for hostel rooms that can accurately detect and alert residents of unauthorized entry. 

 Upon detection of an unauthorized individual entering a room, our  system will promptly capture a snapshot of the individual and transmit the image to the respective room owners via a notification directly to their mobile devices wherein only the room owners will have access to that.

"Mhanjhusriee","Baskar","Infinite Innovators Inc. (III)","Open Innovation","VIT Chennai","In the current operation of our campus health center, the absence of a structured, enforceable queue management system has led to significant inefficiencies and dissatisfaction among students seeking medical care. Despite previous attempts to implement a token-based system, challenges such as non-compliance and token mismanagement have undermined its effectiveness, resulting in disorderly queues, increased wait times, and a perceived lack of fairness in patient service. This situation not only compromises the accessibility and quality of healthcare for students but also places unnecessary stress on the health center's staff, further exacerbating the center's operational challenges.

Given this backdrop, there is a pressing need for an innovative solution that transcends the limitations of physical token systems and addresses the core issues of compliance, transparency, and fairness in patient queue management. The proposed solution is to develop and implement an online token system based on the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) principle, leveraging digital technology to streamline the appointment and waiting process at the health center. This system aims to ensure an equitable and efficient mechanism for managing patient flow, significantly improving the healthcare experience for both students and staff.","The proposed system is a queue management application catering to two primary entities: doctors and students. Doctors utilize a dedicated dashboard to oversee the queue status, while students interact with a personalized dashboard to secure appointments. Flask is selected for the backend infrastructure, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript constitute the frontend interface. SQL Alchemy is employed for database management.

# *Key Features:*

***Doctor Dashboard:***

Provides real-time visibility into the queue status.
Facilitates efficient management of appointments.
Enables access to student visit logs for medical center records.

***Student Dashboard:***

Allows students to book appointment tokens.
Offers a user-friendly interface for managing appointments and viewing relevant details.

***Appointment Workflow:***

When a student requests a token, appointment details are promptly relayed to the doctor's dashboard.
Doctors can then notify students about their upcoming appointments to ensure streamlined coordination.","**Database Schema Design:**

Utilize SQL Alchemy to architect the database schema, encompassing entities such as doctors, students, appointments, and visit logs. Establish appropriate relationships between these entities.

**Backend Development with Flask:**

Develop RESTful APIs using Flask to handle operations such as token requests, appointment management, and visit log retrieval. Ensure robust error handling and validation mechanisms.

**Frontend Development:**

Implement responsive frontend interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Design intuitive doctor and student dashboards tailored to their respective needs, incorporating features like appointment scheduling and queue monitoring.

**Token Request and Notification System:**

Upon a student's token request, swiftly update the doctor's dashboard with the relevant appointment details.
Enable doctors to notify students about upcoming appointments through the application interface or external communication channels.

**Logging and Audit Trail:**

Implement comprehensive logging mechanisms to track student visits and appointments for audit and record-keeping purposes.

**Testing and Deployment:**

Conduct rigorous testing to validate system functionality, security, and performance.
Deploy the application to a production environment following best practices for scalability and reliability.

**Conclusion:**
By leveraging Flask for backend development, HTML/CSS/JS for frontend design, and SQL Alchemy for database management, the proposed queue management system ensures seamless coordination between doctors and students. With features like real-time updates, appointment scheduling, and robust logging capabilities, the system aims to enhance operational efficiency and improve the overall healthcare experience for all stakeholders.","Dhanush M - 21BAI1744

"Pranav","P","Error 404","Hostel Hurdles","VIT Vellore","Idea Title: VITI-Care: Your Hostel Roommate (App)
Problem: Hostel living, while fostering independence and social connections, can be a breeding ground for clutter and disorganization. Students have to physically register at the Warden's office to get their room cleaned or get some furniture or light repaired and more often than not either the students do not receive the required help or receive a very delayed service. Between packed schedules and potentially shared living areas, maintaining a clean room feels like a constant uphill battle for students.

VITI-Care goes beyond just being a cleaning and maintainance app - it's your virtual roommate and cheerleader for a clean and healthy hostel life.","Introducing a Room Cleaning Application tailored for hostel students addresses the aforementioned challenges by providing a seamless platform for requesting and tracking room cleaning services. This application will be accessible to both hostel residents and cleaning helpers, facilitating efficient communication and task management.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The application will feature an intuitive interface for hostel residents to easily request room cleaning and maintenance services with just a few taps on their smartphones from the comfort of their rooms.

Real-Time Notifications: Helpers will receive instant notifications on the application whenever a room cleaning or maintenance request is made, ensuring prompt response and service delivery.

QR Code Verification: Upon completion of room cleaning or maintenance service, the workers will scan a unique QR code displayed on the resident's smartphone. This serves as verification of service completion and ensures accountability.

Centralized Monitoring: Hostel authorities will have access to a centralized dashboard to monitor the activities, track performance metrics, and address any issues promptly.

Feedback Mechanism: Hostel residents can provide feedback on the quality of services received, enabling continuous improvement.

Security and Privacy: Robust security measures will be implemented to safeguard user data and privacy, ensuring a secure environment for both residents and helpers.

Working:
Our application consists of two sections:  one user login for the students and one for the workers. The students shall log in to the app using their registration number and room number while workers will login using their assigned floors and unique Id. Once  the students request for a room cleaning or maintenance service on the app along with a preferred time slot (in which they intend to receive that service), the wardens and the workers pertaining to that specific floor shall receive a notification on their app. Whichever worker is free at the moment shall accept the request and provide the necessary help. Once the room is cleaned, the workers will have to scan a QR code on the app of the request initiator. On every QR code scan, the workers shall earn points which will be  added to their profile. We also aim to create a website (admin portal) for the hostel authorities. The wardens will have access to the profiles of the workers and also to all requests from the hostel residents. Thus the wardens will be able to track and monitor the work of all the workers and will also be able to address the issue of pending requests. 

Benefits:

Streamlined Process: Simplifies the process of requesting and delivering room cleaning and maintenance services, enhancing overall efficiency.
Enhanced Accountability: QR code verification ensures transparency and accountability in cleaning operations.
Flexible Timings: It often occurs that students do not receive the required service at a suitable time(for eg: no one might be present in the room,etc). Thus app also provides a option for the students to select suitable timings of when they intend to receive the service.
Improved Resident Satisfaction: Timely and consistent cleaning and maintenance services contribute to higher resident satisfaction and a healthier living environment.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Centralized monitoring enables data analysis for informed decision-making and performance evaluation.
Cost and Resource Optimization: Optimizes cleaning resources and reduces operational costs through efficient task allocation and scheduling.

Conclusion:

VITI-CARE is an application for hostel students offers a comprehensive solution to optimize cleaning and maintenance operations, improve resident satisfaction, and enhance administrative oversight. By leveraging technology to streamline processes and foster accountability, this application transforms the hostel cleaning experience into a seamless and efficient endeavor.","Tech Stack-

Problem: Hostel living, while fostering independence and social connections, can be a breeding ground for clutter and disorganization. Students have to physically register at the Warden's office to get their room cleaned or get some furniture or light repaired and more often than not either the students do not receive the required help or receive a very delayed service. Between packed schedules and potentially shared living areas, maintaining a clean room feels like a constant uphill battle for students.

VITI-Care goes beyond just being a cleaning and maintainence app - it's your virtual roommate and cheerleader for a clean and healthy hostel life.","Introducing a Room Cleaning Application tailored for hostel students addresses the aforementioned challenges by providing a seamless platform for requesting and tracking room cleaning services. This application will be accessible to both hostel residents and cleaning helpers, facilitating efficient communication and task management.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The application will feature an intuitive interface for hostel residents to easily request room cleaning and maintenance services with just a few taps on their smartphones from the comfort of their rooms.

Real-Time Notifications: Helpers will receive instant notifications on the application whenever a room cleaning or maintenance request is made, ensuring prompt response and service delivery.

QR Code Verification: Upon completion of room cleaning or maintenance service, the workers will scan a unique QR code displayed on the resident's smartphone. This serves as verification of service completion and ensures accountability.

Centralized Monitoring: Hostel authorities will have access to a centralized dashboard to monitor the activities, track performance metrics, and address any issues promptly.

Feedback Mechanism: Hostel residents can provide feedback on the quality of services received, enabling continuous improvement.

Security and Privacy: Robust security measures will be implemented to safeguard user data and privacy, ensuring a secure environment for both residents and helpers.

Working:
Our application consists of two sections:  one user login for the students and one for the workers. The students shall log in to the app using their registration number and room number while workers will login using their assigned floors and unique Id. Once  the students request for a room cleaning or maintenance service on the app along with a preferred time slot (in which they intend to receive that service), the wardens and the workers pertaining to that specific floor shall receive a notification on their app. Whichever worker is free at the moment shall accept the request and provide the necessary help. Once the room is cleaned, the workers will have to scan a QR code on the app of the request initiator. On every QR code scan, the workers shall earn points which will be  added to their profile. We also aim to create a website (admin portal) for the hostel authorities. The wardens will have access to the profiles of the workers and also to all requests from the hostel residents. Thus the wardens will be able to track and monitor the work of all the workers and will also be able to address the issue of pending requests. 

Benefits:

Streamlined Process: Simplifies the process of requesting and delivering room cleaning and maintenance services, enhancing overall efficiency.
Enhanced Accountability: QR code verification ensures transparency and accountability in cleaning operations.
Flexible Timings: It often occurs that students do not receive the required service at a suitable time(for eg: no one might be present in the room,etc). Thus app also provides a option for the students to select suitable timings of when they intend to receive the service.
Improved Resident Satisfaction: Timely and consistent cleaning and maintenance services contribute to higher resident satisfaction and a healthier living environment.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Centralized monitoring enables data analysis for informed decision-making and performance evaluation.
Cost and Resource Optimization: Optimizes cleaning resources and reduces operational costs through efficient task allocation and scheduling.

Conclusion:

VITI-CARE is an application for hostel students offers a comprehensive solution to optimize cleaning and maintenance operations, improve resident satisfaction, and enhance administrative oversight.

As a result, valuable assets go unused, and individuals struggle to find the items they need, leading to inefficiencies and frustration. Hostel students require a solution that promotes resource sharing, minimizes waste, and provides a convenient way for them to access and rent various items essential for their academic and personal needs.
Limited Visibility: Product listings posted on informal channels have limited visibility, restricting students' access to a diverse range of items. As a result, students may miss out on opportunities to discover relevant listings or connect with potential buyers or sellers beyond their immediate social circles.
Lack of Centralized Platform: The absence of a centralized marketplace means that students must navigate multiple channels to find what they need. This lack of a single, easily accessible platform results in wasted time and effort sifting through different sources to buy or sell items.","VelocityMart aims to revolutionize resource sharing and management within college hostel communities by providing a centralized platform for students to easily rent, share, and access various items, including textbooks, notes, sports equipment, mattresses, and other essentials. By leveraging modern technologies and user-centric design principles, VelocityMart fosters a sustainable and collaborative environment where students can maximize the utility of resources while minimizing waste.


Key Features:

"Dhanush","M","Infinite Innovators Inc. (III)","Open Innovation","VIT Chennai","In the current operation of our campus health center, the absence of a structured, enforceable queue management system has led to significant inefficiencies and dissatisfaction among students seeking medical care. Despite previous attempts to implement a token-based system, challenges such as non-compliance and token mismanagement have undermined its effectiveness, resulting in disorderly queues, increased wait times, and a perceived lack of fairness in patient service. This situation not only compromises the accessibility and quality of healthcare for students but also places unnecessary stress on the health center's staff, further exacerbating the center's operational challenges.

Given this backdrop, there is a pressing need for an innovative solution that transcends the limitations of physical token systems and addresses the core issues of compliance, transparency, and fairness in patient queue management. The proposed solution is to develop and implement an online token system based on the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) principle, leveraging digital technology to streamline the appointment and waiting process at the health center. This system aims to ensure an equitable and efficient mechanism for managing patient flow, significantly improving the healthcare experience for both students and staff.","The proposed system is a queue management application catering to two primary entities: doctors and students. Doctors utilize a dedicated dashboard to oversee the queue status, while students interact with a personalized dashboard to secure appointments. Flask is selected for the backend infrastructure, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript constitute the frontend interface. SQL Alchemy is employed for database management.

# **Key Features:**

***`Doctor Dashboard:`***

Provides real-time visibility into the queue status.
Facilitates efficient management of appointments.
Enables access to student visit logs for medical center records.

***`Student Dashboard:`***

Allows students to book appointment tokens.
Offers a user-friendly interface for managing appointments and viewing relevant details.

***`Appointment Workflow:`***

When a student requests a token, appointment details are promptly relayed to the doctor's dashboard.
Doctors can then notify students about their upcoming appointments to ensure streamlined coordination.","***Database Schema Design:***

Utilize SQL Alchemy to architect the database schema, encompassing entities such as doctors, students, appointments, and visit logs. Establish appropriate relationships between these entities.

***Backend Development with Flask:***

Develop RESTful APIs using Flask to handle operations such as token requests, appointment management, and visit log retrieval. Ensure robust error handling and validation mechanisms.

***Frontend Development:***

Implement responsive frontend interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Design intuitive doctor and student dashboards tailored to their respective needs, incorporating features like appointment scheduling and queue monitoring.

***Token Request and Notification System:***

Upon a student's token request, swiftly update the doctor's dashboard with the relevant appointment details.
Enable doctors to notify students about upcoming appointments through the application interface or external communication channels.

***Logging and Audit Trail:***

Implement comprehensive logging mechanisms to track student visits and appointments for audit and record-keeping purposes.

***Testing and Deployment:***

Conduct rigorous testing to validate system functionality, security, and performance.
Deploy the application to a production environment following best practices for scalability and reliability.

***Conclusion:***
By leveraging Flask for backend development, HTML/CSS/JS for frontend design, and SQL Alchemy for database management, the proposed queue management system ensures seamless coordination between doctors and students. With features like real-time updates, appointment scheduling, and robust logging capabilities, the system aims to enhance operational efficiency and improve the overall healthcare experience for all stakeholders.","Dhanush M - 21BAI1744

By using the data recorded and intensive analysis, we can come to a conclusion on whether a person is going through behavioural changes which could be perceived as harmful. This could open a new portal in preventing suicides amongst young adults.","We aim to build a comprehensive model for detecting mood swings by integrating gait analysis with body posture. This approach provides a more holistic understanding of an individual's emotional state compared to existing solutions. Without invading their privacy, we evaluate walking patterns and body posture through which our model enables early intervention and continuous monitoring to enhance overall well-being and quality of life. Our focus on measuring gait parameters through posture and force during walking sets us apart, offering a unique methodology for detecting irregularities and supporting suicide prevention efforts.","Data acquisition is done through two components, a floor mat with pressure or force sensors and cameras fixed in college environment. Using the floor mat, we acquire the pressure map of the foot and using the camera we detect the posture and motion of the person. These data are then sent to our 'Ryzen AI enabled PC' for further processing. The accquired foot pressure pattern is then compared with the pressure pattern of a healthy person and the differences in the pattern is recorded and the posture of the person is also analysed. If there is an erronious pattern, then that person is monitored for the next one week and his data is continuously analyzed. If the erronious pattern still persists, then the concerned authorities are informed for further counselling procedures. The NPU present in the Ryzen PC AI helps us in analysing huge amount of real-time data using Machine Learning models for perfect predictions.

"Vallari","Ashar","Campus Detectives","Open Innovation","VIT Chennai","Problem Statement:
The current approach to handling lost items among students involves handing them over to the nearest watchman, leading to confusion and inefficiency. This method lacks a centralized system, leaving students uncertain about where to retrieve their belongings. The watchman is burdened with maintaining a register of lost items, while students must search multiple locations to find their lost items. This scattered approach hampers the process for both authorities and students, calling for a centralized lost-and-found system to streamline operations and improve convenience.","The proposed solution aims to alleviate both the physical and mental stress associated with losing items on campus. By establishing a systematic approach, where the campus is divided into areas with dedicated lost and found hubs, the burden on students to search extensively for their lost belongings is reduced. Physically, students no longer need to scour multiple locations, minimizing exhaustion and frustration.

Moreover, the mobile application streamlines the process for students by allowing them to initiate a search with just a few taps, reducing the mental strain of worrying about their lost items. Continuous searches conducted by the app in the centralized database ensure that students are promptly notified if their lost item is found. This proactive approach lessens the anxiety and uncertainty students may experience when trying to locate their belongings.

Overall, this solution not only accelerates the retrieval of lost items but also promotes a more efficient and less stressful experience for both students and campus authorities.","Front-End of the mobile application

"Karan","Kumar","bigbrain404","Students' Wellbeing","VIT Chennai","**Long queues and wasted time:**
Due to the large number of students taking the CAT-2 exams or any other exam, 
there are often long queues for printing study materials. 
This can result in students wasting valuable time that could be spent studying.

**Crowd gathering:** 
During exams, high demand for printed notes leads to large crowds at xerox shops, 
causing difficulties for students who need prints and for others as well who don’t. 

**Network Issues:**
Near photocopying shops, internet connectivity issues often arise, making it difficult 
for students to send their documents to the photocopying staff.


**Miscommunication and Insufficient use of resources:** 
The photocopying staff receives documents to print via email, which is disorganized 
and lead to miscommunication and confusion. More use of manpower and machine
is required due to a lot of students coming at the same time.","# VPRINT - A Mobile App for Streamlined Printing Services

**Real-Time Availability:** Check which photocopying shop is less busy in real-time and place your order accordingly.

**Document Upload:** Upload your documents and provide a short description of how you want your notes to be printed.

**Contextual Understanding:** The app understands your printing requirements and provides an estimated time for when your order will be ready.

**Smart Organization:** The app categorizes and stores your printing orders, making it easy to track and manage them.","**Expo (React Native)**

"Sarthak","Krishak","Error 404","Hostel Hurdles","VIT Vellore","# **Idea Title: VITI-Care: Your Hostel Roommate (App)**

**Problem:**  Hostel living, while fostering independence and social connections, can be a breeding ground for clutter and disorganization. Students have to physically register at the Warden's office to get their room cleaned or get some furniture or light repaired and more often than not either the students do not receive the required help or receive a very delayed service. Between packed schedules and potentially shared living areas, maintaining a clean room feels like a constant uphill battle for students.

**VITI-Care goes beyond just being a cleaning and maintainance app - it's your virtual roommate and cheerleader for a clean and healthy hostel life.**","# **Idea Title: VITI-Care: A Room Cleaning Companion for Hostel Students**

VITI-Care is a mobile app designed to help hostel students keep their rooms clean and organized.

**Solution:** VITI-Care is a mobile application that empowers hostel students to manage their room cleaning needs seamlessly.  Forget rigid schedules and unreliable services!

**Key Features - Focused on Student Benefits:**

• Instant On-Demand Cleaning: Request a cleaning with a few taps, anytime, anywhere within the hostel. No need for pre-scheduling or waiting for unreliable services.

• QR Code Verification: Upon completion, scan a unique QR code for service verification and accountability.

• Hostel Management Integration: Offer a centralized dashboard for hostel authorities to monitor cleaning activities (additional service for hostels).

• Real-Time Tracking: Monitor cleaning progress in real-time, allowing you to plan your time effectively.

• Rate and Review System: Provide feedback on cleaning quality, ensuring high standards are maintained.

VITI-Care empowers students to take control of their hostel living experience by providing a convenient, transparent, and reliable on-demand cleaning solution.

**Benefits for Hostel Students:**

• Reduced Stress and Improved Health: Maintain a clean and organized room with minimal effort, promoting well-being and reducing allergy risks.

• Time Management and Increased Productivity: Focus on studies and social activities, not cleaning your room.

• Peace of Mind: Relax knowing your room is being cleaned by reliable and vetted professionals.

• Cost and Resource Optimization: Optimizes cleaning resources and reduces operational costs through efficient task allocation and scheduling.


**Working:**
Our application consists of two sections:  one user login for the students and one for the workers. The students shall log in to the app using their registration number and room number while workers will login using their assigned floors and unique Id. Once  the students request for a room cleaning or maintenance service on the app along with a preferred time slot (in which they intend to receive that service), the wardens and the workers pertaining to that specific floor shall receive a notification on their app. Whichever worker is free at the moment shall accept the request and provide the necessary help. Once the room is cleaned, the workers will have to scan a QR code on the app of the request initiator. On every QR code scan, the workers shall earn points which will be  added to their profile. We also aim to create a website (admin portal) for the hostel authorities. The wardens will have access to the profiles of the workers and also to all requests from the hostel residents. Thus the wardens will be able to track and monitor the work of all the workers and will also be able to address the issue of pending requests. 



**Conclusion:**
VITI-Care addresses a common pain point for hostel students by offering a comprehensive solution that goes beyond cleaning. By providing personalized guidance, fostering motivation through rewards and community, and promoting well-being, VITI-Clean empowers students to maintain a clean and healthy living space, ultimately contributing to their overall success and fostering a positive hostel experience.","# **Tech Stack-**

**Long queues and wasted time:**
Due to the large number of students taking the CAT-2 exams or any other exam, 
there are often long queues for printing study materials. 
This can result in students wasting valuable time that could be spent studying.

**Crowd gathering:** 
During exams, high demand for printed notes leads to large crowds at xerox shops, 
causing difficulties for students who need prints and for others as well who don’t. 

**Network Issues:**
Near photocopying shops, internet connectivity issues often arise, making it difficult 
for students to send their documents to the photocopying staff.


**Miscommunication and Insufficient use of resources:** 
The photocopying staff receives documents to print via email, which is disorganized 
and lead to miscommunication and confusion. More use of manpower and machine
is required due to a lot of students coming at the same time.

Problem: Hostel living, while fostering independence and social connections, can be a breeding ground for clutter and disorganization. Students have to physically register at the Warden's office to get their room cleaned or get some furniture or light repaired and more often than not either the students do not receive the required help or receive a very delayed service. Between packed schedules and potentially shared living areas, maintaining a clean room feels like a constant uphill battle for students.

VITI-Care goes beyond just being a cleaning and maintainance app - it's your virtual roommate and cheerleader for a clean and healthy hostel life.","We are introducing a Room Cleaning Application tailored for hostel students which addresses the aforementioned challenges by providing a seamless platform for requesting and tracking room cleaning services. This application will be accessible to both hostel residents and cleaning helpers, facilitating efficient communication and task management.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The application will feature an intuitive interface for hostel residents to easily request room cleaning and maintenance services with just a few taps on their smartphones from the comfort of their rooms.

Real-Time Notifications: Helpers will receive instant notifications on the application whenever a room cleaning or maintenance request is made, ensuring prompt response and service delivery.

QR Code Verification: Upon completion of room cleaning or maintenance service, the workers will scan a unique QR code displayed on the resident's smartphone. This serves as verification of service completion and ensures accountability.

Centralized Monitoring: Hostel authorities will have access to a centralized dashboard to monitor the activities, track performance metrics, and address any issues promptly.

Feedback Mechanism: Hostel residents can provide feedback on the quality of services received, enabling continuous improvement.

Security and Privacy: Robust security measures will be implemented to safeguard user data and privacy, ensuring a secure environment for both residents and helpers.

Working:
Our application consists of two sections:  one user login for the students and one for the workers. The students shall log in to the app using their registration number and room number while workers will login using their assigned floors and unique Id. Once  the students request for a room cleaning or maintenance service on the app along with a preferred time slot (in which they intend to receive that service), the wardens and the workers pertaining to that specific floor shall receive a notification on their app. Whichever worker is free at the moment shall accept the request and provide the necessary help. Once the room is cleaned, the workers will have to scan a QR code on the app of the request initiator. On every QR code scan, the workers shall earn points which will be  added to their profile. We also aim to create a website (admin portal) for the hostel authorities. The wardens will have access to the profiles of the workers and also to all requests from the hostel residents. Thus the wardens will be able to track and monitor the work of all the workers and will also be able to address the issue of pending requests. 

Benefits:

Streamlined Process: Simplifies the process of requesting and delivering room cleaning and maintenance services, enhancing overall efficiency.
Enhanced Accountability: QR code verification ensures transparency and accountability in cleaning operations.
Flexible Timings: It often occurs that students do not receive the required service at a suitable time(for eg: no one might be present in the room,etc). Thus app also provides a option for the students to select suitable timings of when they intend to receive the service.
Improved Resident Satisfaction: Timely and consistent cleaning and maintenance services contribute to higher resident satisfaction and a healthier living environment.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Centralized monitoring enables data analysis for informed decision-making and performance evaluation.
Cost and Resource Optimization: Optimizes cleaning resources and reduces operational costs through efficient task allocation and scheduling.

Conclusion:

VITI-CARE is an application for hostel students offers a comprehensive solution to optimize cleaning and maintenance operations, improve resident satisfaction, and enhance administrative oversight. By leveraging technology to streamline processes and foster accountability, this application transforms the hostel cleaning experience into a seamless and efficient endeavor.","• Mobile App Development:

There's plethora of problems faced by students in college, one of the most common and undiagonized one being mood swings which is one of the leading cause to depression and suicide. Gait analysis helps us in detecting the bodily and facial motion. By using the data recorded and intensive analysis, we can come to a conclusion on whether a person is going through behavioural changes which could be perceived as harmful. This could open a new portal in preventing suicides amongst young adults.","We aim to build a comprehensive model for detecting mood swings by integrating gait analysis with body posture. This approach provides a more holistic understanding of an individual's emotional state compared to existing solutions. Without invading their privacy, we evaluate walking patterns and body posture through which our model enables early intervention and continuous monitoring to enhance overall well-being and quality of life. Our focus on measuring gait parameters through posture and force during walking sets us apart, offering a unique methodology for detecting irregularities and supporting suicide prevention efforts.","Data acquisition is done through two components, a floor mat with pressure or force sensors and cameras fixed in college environment. Using the floor mat, we acquire the pressure map of the foot and using the camera we detect the posture and motion of the person. These data are then sent to our 'Ryzen AI enabled PC' for further processing. The accquired foot pressure pattern is then compared with the pressure pattern of a healthy person and the differences in the pattern is recorded and the posture of the person is also analysed. If there is an erronious pattern, then that person is monitored for the next one week and his data is continuously analyzed. If the erronious pattern still persists, then the concerned authorities are informed for further counselling procedures. The NPU present in the Ryzen PC AI helps us in analysing huge amount of real-time data using Machine Learning models for perfect predictions.

Firstly, there's a challenge in effectively resolving student complaints regarding both paid and free gym services, particularly concerning the prolonged resolution time for issues such as non-functional equipment in the free gym area, as well as other items such as broken table-tennis bat, badminton racquets. Secondly, overcrowding during peak hours disrupts the gym experience, exacerbated by a lack of adherence to time-slot schedules and unchecked access for users. Also limited availability of other sport items, makes it difficult for students. Finally, inadequate maintenance of sports accessories both on-campus and in hostels, coupled with limited equipment availability, leads to inefficient time utilization and unequal access to gym facilities among students. These issues collectively impact the overall satisfaction and fairness of the gym and sports experience for students.","The proposed improvements for complaint management at the gym aim to streamline the process by establishing a direct channel for students to address their concerns with the responsible authorities, bypassing the need for intermediaries like the gym manager. This initiative seeks to enhance efficiency and transparency in resolving issues promptly. Additionally, to tackle overcrowding during peak hours, a flexible time-slot scheduling system for both paid and free gym services is suggested, offering users more options for a comfortable workout experience. This is not only for gym, but also for the sport equipments which is available in the hostels as well as in the campus, where people can choose time-slots for their usage of equipments. Time management and accountability will be further enforced through the implementation of RFID technology, regulating gym usage within designated time slots to ensure fair access for all. Moreover, to enhance equipment maintenance and tracking, RFID stickers will be affixed to sports equipment, facilitating efficient monitoring and maintenance processes while also ensuring accountability through user ID card scanning before equipment usage.","React Native(For App)

"Archisman","Panda","Maelstrom","Hostel Student welfare","VIT Chennai","The billing and credit transactions in the CRCL Food Park mess are done manually in a time-consuming process, leading to long queues and increased waiting time, which can even go up to 20 minutes. This is a major inconvenience for students and staff alike, and is a deterrent for students who would otherwise opt for special mess. The lack of an automated transaction system results in inefficient service, and the waiting time is especially significant during the final quarter of the mess hours when we have to attend classes after having lunch. The inconveniences are further increased if a student fails to hear the token number due to the large crowd in the Food Park mess. Additionally, manual transactions leave room for error, causing false orders being placed, which results in conflicts between students and the managers. By negatively impacting the experience, this not only causes inconvenience to students, but also induces losses for the facilities, since the inflow of orders will decrease in the presence of longer queues. Addressing this issue is of urgent importance to streamline transactions, and greatly improve the Food Park experience.","We propose to build a mobile application to automate the entire transaction process of Food Park, thus negating the need for long queues as well as reducing the waiting time. Our app will list the menu, showcasing the currently available vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes as well as items under 'Today's Choices' for each meal. Students can choose the items they wish to order, and place the order in the app. This will be greatly beneficial, as we can place an order from our room or our class as it is about to end, then go to the mess within some time and wait for less time to collect our order. The order will be shown to the managers in the Food Park kitchen through another interface, and will generate a token; after finishing the order, they can close it, sending a notification to the student that their order is finished, following which they can collect it. This is convenient because this removes the possibility of the student not hearing the order being called out, as well as is convenient for the staff. The credits of all students will be stored, and transactions will deduce the required credits from their account, and show them the new amount as well as previous transactions to maintain transparency. The history of transactions will also be available to the facilities. Our app will also cater to students who are not members of Food Park but wish to access the paid facility. We will have an integrated real-time payment system, directly connecting transactions between the student and the receiving account. This will give the student full responsibility for their credits, and we will not be able to cause any altercations in the mess. The app will also be password-protected behind VTOP credentials to prevent anyone from completing transactions under another account. This will streamline the transactions, causing efficiency and convenience to us as well as our mess staff.","We will employ **React Native** and **Redux** for the Front-End of the app. To manage the Back-End, we will be using **Node.JS** along with the **Express.JS** framework. **Firebase** Database will be employed to store the transactions and credits and update them in real time.

VIT students face challenges in maintaining their ID cards and room keys effectively, leading to various security and convenience issues. Despite the requirement for students to wear ID cards in academic buildings, many forget, facing consequences such as restricted access and penalties. Additionally, the lack of proper maintenance of room keys leads to doors being left unlocked, increasing the risk of theft and unauthorized entry into hostel rooms. These issues highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to streamline ID card and room key management processes, ensuring students' safety and convenience within the VIT hostel environment.","""Our solution integrates both the identified problems into a single, efficient system: a Smart Door Lock System. Here's how it works:

1) Data obtaining: After hostel counselling the respective room member's registration numbers are sent to the system. Later the data is fed to respective scanners of hostel room.

2) Registration: Each person's register number in a particular room is scanned using the respective scanner on the door, serving as the key to access the room.

3) Manual Operation: Manual operation options are provided inside and outside the room to address worst-case scenarios such as sensor or scanner failures.

4) FSR Sensor System: Inside the room, an FSR sensor system determines when to activate the smart lock system by detecting the presence of ID cards. This not only ensures room security but also serves as a designated place for students to store their ID cards, reducing the likelihood of forgetfulness.

5) Data Storage and Management: Information regarding who locks and unlocks the door is sent to the cloud for emergency purposes and future reference.

Firstly, there's a challenge in effectively resolving student complaints regarding both paid and free gym services, particularly concerning the prolonged resolution time for issues such as non-functional equipment in the free gym area, as well as other items such as broken table-tennis bat, badminton racquets. Secondly, overcrowding during peak hours disrupts the gym experience, exacerbated by a lack of adherence to time-slot schedules and unchecked access for users. Also limited availability of other sport items, makes it difficult for students. Finally, inadequate maintenance of sports accessories both on-campus and in hostels, coupled with limited equipment availability, leads to inefficient time utilization and unequal access to gym facilities among students. These issues collectively impact the overall satisfaction and fairness of the gym and sports experience for students.","he proposed improvements for complaint management at the gym aim to streamline the process by establishing a direct channel for students to address their concerns with the responsible authorities, bypassing the need for intermediaries like the gym manager.

"Ashahar","Yunus Khan","Soaring Coders","Campus Sustainability","VIT Chennai","In our campus, resource reusability poses a significant challenge, particularly among hostel students. Items such as books, notes, sports equipment, mattresses, and other essentials are frequently *underutilized or discarded*, contributing to unnecessary waste and environmental 
impact. Compounding this issue is the absence of a centralized platform that facilitates efficient renting or sharing of these resources within the hostel community. As a result, valuable assets go unused, and individuals struggle to find the items they need, leading to inefficiencies and frustration. Hostel students require a solution that promotes resource sharing, minimizes waste, and provides a convenient way for them to access and rent various items essential for their academic and personal needs.
Limited Visibility: Product listings posted on informal channels have limited visibility, restricting students' access to a diverse range of items. As a result, students may miss out on opportunities to discover relevant listings or connect with potential buyers or sellers beyond their immediate social circles.
Lack of Centralized Platform: The absence of a centralized marketplace means that students must navigate multiple channels to find what they need. This lack of a single, easily accessible platform results in wasted time and effort sifting through different sources to buy or sell items.","Problem Statement VelocityMart aims to revolutionize resource sharing and management within college hostel communities by providing a centralized platform for students to easily rent, share, and access various items, including textbooks, notes, sports equipment, mattresses, and other essentials.
